This tool automatically aggregates disposable email domains through a combination of community contributions and web scraping. The system relies on maintainers who curate an `allow_list.txt` of legitimate domains while actively detecting disposable providers.  

## Reporting Incorrectly Flagged Domains

If you believe a legitimate domain has been mistakenly identified as disposable, you can help improve the validator by contributing to our allow list.

**How to contribute:**
1. Verify the domain is truly non-disposable (permanent email service)
2. Add the domain to [`allow_list.txt`](./allow_list.txt)
3. Submit a pull request with your addition

We welcome community contributions to help maintain the accuracy of our validation system.
