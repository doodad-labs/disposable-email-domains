# Manual whitelist of reserved or restricted top-level domains (TLDs).
# These TLDs are controlled by governments, accredited institutions, or
# heavily regulated entities, and are not open for general public registration.
# This list exists to reduce false positives in domain filtering systems.
#
# Contribution guidelines:
# - Groups must be ordered alphabetically by heading.
# - TLDs within each group must be in strict alphabetical order.
# - Only include TLDs that are officially restricted or reserved (i.e. not available for unrestricted public registration).
# - Lowercase only.
# - Do not include a leading dot (e.g. use "gov", not ".gov").
